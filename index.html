<h1>Early Life</h1>
<p>Born April 22, 1999, I gren up in Abilene, Texas and did not move until after I graduated highschool from Wylie High school in 2017. I moved around a few times after graduation, including places like Weatherford, where I attended Weatherford College, and Denton, where I planned to attend UNT despite Covid-19 which then put me back in Abilene, and ultimately, TSTC. Originally, my education plan consisted of going to UNT to get my software engineering degree, but life has its own plans sometimes. Concluding my journey, being back in Abilene led me to TSTC where I hope to further my education to establish a career path in my field of study. This will provide me with background experience for my future endeavors, while simultaneously finishing my engineering degree later on.</p>
