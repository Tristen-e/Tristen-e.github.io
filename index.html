<p>Born April 22, 1999, I had grown up in Abilene, Texas and did not move until after I graduated highschool from Wylie High school in 2017. During High school, I loved running, in track and outside of school, but the majority of my time was spent skateboarding and hanging out with my friends and brothers. I moved around a few times after graduation, including places like Weatherford, where I attended Weatherford College, and Denton, where I planned to attend UNT despite Covid-19 which then put me back in Abilene, and eventually, TSTC.</p>
